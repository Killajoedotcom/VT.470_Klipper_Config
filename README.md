# VT.470 Klipper Config
This is the config of my Voron Trident 350 Serial:VT.470

Be aware I see my config as WIP and it can and will change from time to time. I normally do only checkin stuff that is tested and run with the base klipper branch. I am not a developer and use this repo as sort of a backup to house my configuration.
